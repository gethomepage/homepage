# Contributing to Homepage

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the project
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Any contributions you make will be under the GNU General Public License v3.0

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github [discussions](https://github.com/gethomepage/homepage/discussions)

We use GitHub discussions to triage bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new discussion](https://github.com/gethomepage/homepage/discussions/new?category=support); it's that easy! Please do not open an issue unless instructed to do so by a project maintainer.

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample configurations

Homepage includes a lot of configuration options and is often deploying in larger systems. Please include as much information (configurations, deployment method, Docker & API versions, etc) as you can when reporting an issue.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give example configurations if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People _love_ thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Development Guidelines

Please see the [documentation regarding development](https://gethomepage.dev/more/development/) and specifically the [guidelines for new service widgets](https://gethomepage.dev/more/development/#service-widget-guidelines) if you are considering making one.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

Please see information in the docs regarding [code formatting with pre-commit hooks](https://gethomepage.dev/more/development/#code-formatting-with-pre-commit-hooks).

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its GNU General Public License.

## Use of AI for pull requests

In general, homepage does not accept "AI-generated" PRs. If you choose to use something like that to aid the development process to generate a significant proportion of the pull request, please make sure this is explicitly stated in the PR itself.

## Automatic Respository Maintenance

The homepage team appreciates all effort and interest from the community in filing bug reports, creating feature requests, sharing ideas and helping other community members. That said, in an effort to keep the repository organized and managebale the project uses automatic handling of certain areas:

- Issues, pull requests and discussions that are closed will be locked after 30 days of inactivity.
- Discussions with a marked answer will be automatically closed.
- Discussions in the 'General' or 'Support' categories will be closed after 180 days of inactivity.
- Feature requests that do not meet the following thresholds will be closed: 10 "up-votes" after 180 days of inactivity or 20 "up-votes" after 365 days.

In all cases, threads can be re-opened by project maintainers and, of course, users can always create a new discussion for related concerns.
Finally, remember that all information remains searchable and 'closed' feature requests can still serve as inspiration for new features.

Thank you all for your contributions.
