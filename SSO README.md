Security Notice ðŸ”’
Please note that when using features such as widgets, Homepage can access personal information (for example from your home automation system) and Homepage currently does not (and is not planned to) include any authentication layer itself. Thus, we recommend homepage be deployed behind a reverse proxy including authentication, SSL etc, and / or behind a VPN. When enabling SSO with Keycloak, ensure secure configuration of your Keycloak instance and use HTTPS for all public-facing URLs.
With Docker
Using docker compose:
services:
  homepage:
    image: ghcr.io/gethomepage/homepage:latest
    container_name: homepage
    environment:
      HOMEPAGE_ALLOWED_HOSTS: gethomepage.dev # required, may need port. See gethomepage.dev/installation/#homepage_allowed_hosts
      PUID: 1000 # optional, your user id
      PGID: 1000 # optional, your group id
      # Optional SSO with Keycloak
      ENABLE_SSO: "true" # set to "false" to disable SSO
      NEXTAUTH_URL: http://localhost:3000 # or your public domain, e.g., https://homepage.example.com
      NEXTAUTH_SECRET: your-random-secret-string # generate a secure random string
      KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID: your-keycloak-client-id # e.g., homepage
      KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET: your-keycloak-client-secret # from Keycloak admin console
      KEYCLOAK_ISSUER: https://keycloak.example.com/realms/your-realm # e.g., https://keycloak.nydaforge.au/realms/master
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    volumes:
      - /path/to/config:/app/config # Make sure your local config directory exists
      - /path/to/images:/app/public/images # Optional, for custom images
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro # optional, for docker integrations
    restart: unless-stopped

or docker run:
docker run -d --name homepage \
  -e HOMEPAGE_ALLOWED_HOSTS=gethomepage.dev \
  -e PUID=1000 \
  -e PGID=1000 \
  -e ENABLE_SSO=true \

  -e KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET=your-keycloak-client-secret \
  -e KEYCLOAK_ISSUER=https://keycloak.example.com/realms/your-realm \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v /path/to/config:/app/config \

  ghcr.io/gethomepage/homepage:latest

From Source
First, clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/gethomepage/homepage.git

Then install dependencies and build the production bundle:
pnpm install
pnpm build

If this is your first time starting, copy the src/skeleton directory to config/ to populate initial example config files.
Finally, run the server in production mode:
pnpm start

Configuration
Please refer to the homepage documentation website for more information. Everything you need to know about configuring Homepage is there. Please read everything carefully before asking for help, as most questions are answered there or are simple YAML configuration issues.
Single Sign-On (SSO) with Keycloak
Homepage supports optional Single Sign-On (SSO) using Keycloak for secure user authentication. When enabled, users must log in via Keycloak to access the dashboard, with an optional password-based login fallback.
Prerequisites

A running Keycloak instance (e.g., https://keycloak.example.com).
A Keycloak realm (e.g., master) with a configured client (e.g., homepage).
Access to the Keycloak admin console to configure the client.

Configuration Steps

Set Up Keycloak Client:

In the Keycloak admin console, create a new client in your realm:
Client ID: e.g., homepage
Access Type: confidential
Valid Redirect URIs: https://your-homepage-domain/api/auth/callback/keycloak (e.g., https://dash.nydaforge.au/api/auth/callback/keycloak)
Web Origins: https://your-homepage-domain (e.g., https://dash.nydaforge.au)


Copy the Client Secret from the Credentials tab.


Configure Environment Variables:

Set the following in your docker-compose.yml, docker run command, or .env file:
ENABLE_SSO: Set to true to enable SSO, false to disable (default: false).
NEXTAUTH_URL: The public URL of your Homepage instance (e.g., https://dash.nydaforge.au).
NEXTAUTH_SECRET: A random, secure string for signing sessions (e.g., generate with openssl rand -base64 32).
KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID: Your Keycloak client ID (e.g., homepage).
KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET: The client secret from Keycloak.
KEYCLOAK_ISSUER: The Keycloak issuer URL (e.g., https://keycloak.example.com/realms/master).




Docker Volume for Configuration:

Mount a local directory to /app/config to persist configuration files (e.g., settings.yaml, services.yaml).
Example: -v /path/to/config:/app/config


Optional Password-Based Auth:

When ENABLE_SSO=true, a password-based login option is available as a fallback.
To disable password-based auth and use Keycloak only, modify src/components/auth/LoginForm.jsx to remove the password form.



Example Docker Run Command
docker run -d --name homepage \
  -e HOMEPAGE_ALLOWED_HOSTS=dash.nydaforge.au \
  -e ENABLE_SSO=true \
  -e NEXTAUTH_URL=https://dash.nydaforge.au \
  -e NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-random-secret-string \
  -e KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID=homepage \
  -e KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET=your-keycloak-client-secret \
  -e KEYCLOAK_ISSUER=https://keycloak.nydaforge.au/realms/master \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v /path/to/config:/app/config \
  -v /path/to/images:/app/public/images \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/gethomepage/homepage:latest

Notes

Security: Use HTTPS for NEXTAUTH_URL and KEYCLOAK_ISSUER in production to protect user data.
Keycloak Admin Console: Ensure the clientâ€™s redirect URI and web origins match your NEXTAUTH_URL.
Disabling SSO: Set ENABLE_SSO=false to revert to unauthenticated access or password-based auth only.
Troubleshooting: Check container logs (docker logs homepage) and browser console for errors. Verify Keycloakâ€™s .well-known/openid-configuration endpoint (e.g., curl https://keycloak.example.com/realms/master/.well-known/openid-configuration).
