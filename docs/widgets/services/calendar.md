This widget shows monthly calendar, with optional integrations to show events from supported widgets.

  showTime: true # optional - show time for event happening today - defaults to false
  timezone: America/Los_Angeles # optional and only when timezone is not detected properly (slightly slower performance) - force timezone for ical events (if it's the same - no change, if missing or different in ical - will be converted to this timezone)
  integrations: # optional
    - type: sonarr # active widget type that is currently enabled on homepage - possible values: radarr, sonarr, lidarr, readarr, ical

      params: # optional - additional params for the service
        unmonitored: true # optional - defaults to false, used with *arr stack
    - type: ical # Show calendar events from another service

      color: zinc # optional - defaults to pre-defined color for the service (zinc for ical)
      params: # optional - additional params for the service
        showName: true # optional - show name before event title in event line - defaults to false
```

## Agenda

This view shows only list of events from configured integrations

```yaml
widget:
  type: calendar
  view: agenda
  maxEvents: 10 # optional - defaults to 10
  showTime: true # optional - show time for event happening today - defaults to false
  previousDays: 3 # optional - shows events since three days ago - defaults to 0
  integrations: # same as in Monthly view example
```

## Integrations

Currently integrated widgets are [sonarr](sonarr.md), [radarr](radarr.md), [lidarr](lidarr.md) and [readarr](readarr.md).

Supported colors can be found on [color palette](../../configs/settings.md#color-palette).

### iCal

This custom integration allows you to show events from any calendar that supports iCal format, for example, Google Calendar (go to `Settings`, select specific calendar, go to `Integrate calendar`, copy URL from `Public Address in iCal format`).
