```yaml
widget:
  type: yourspotify
  url: http://your-spotify-server.host.or.ip
  key: apikeyapikeyapikeyapikeyapikey
  interval: month # optional, defaults to week
```

#### Interval

Allowed values for `interval`: `day`, `week`, `month`, `year`, `all`.

!!! note

    `interval` is different from predefined intervals you see in `Your Spotify`'s UI.
    For example, `This week` in UI means _from the start of this week_, here `week` means _past 7 days_.
