# Getting Started

For configuration options, examples and more, [please check out the homepage documentation](http://gethomepage.dev).

## With Docker

Using docker compose:

```yaml
version: "3.3"
services:
  homepage:
    image: ghcr.io/gethomepage/homepage:latest
    container_name: homepage
    environment:
      PUID: 1000 -- optional, your user id
      PGID: 1000 -- optional, your group id
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    volumes:
      - /path/to/config:/app/config # Make sure your local config directory exists
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro # optional, for docker integrations
    restart: unless-stopped
```

or docker run:

```bash
docker run --name homepage \
  -e PUID=1000 \
  -e PGID=1000 \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v /path/to/config:/app/config \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/gethomepage/homepage:latest
```

## With Node

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gethomepage/homepage.git
```

Then install dependencies and build the production bundle (I'm using pnpm here, you can use npm or yarn if you like):

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

If this is your first time starting, copy the `src/skeleton` directory to `config/` to populate initial example config files.

Finally, run the server in production mode:

```bash
pnpm start
```

or development mode:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

# Configuration

Please refer to the [homepage documentation](https://gethomepage.dev/) website for more information. Everything you need to know about configuring Homepage is there. Please read everything carefully before asking for help, as most questions are answered there or are simple YAML configuration issues.

# Development

Install NPM packages, this project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (and so should you!):

```bash
pnpm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to start.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application, see their documentation for more information.

# Documentation

The homepage documentation is available at [https://gethomepage.dev/](https://gethomepage.dev/).

Homepage uses Material for MkDocs for documentation. To run the documentation locally, first install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
mkdocs serve # or build, to build the static site
```
